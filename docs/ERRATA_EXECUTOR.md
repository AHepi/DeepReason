# Errata — the less-capable-executor infrastructure

Started 2026-08-03 at the operator's request ("this process needs to go in
its own errata. But wait for the results and keep monitoring progress.").

## Scope

This ledger tracks THE PROCESS, not the codebase: the infrastructure built
on 2026-08-03 to let a less capable model operate DeepReason —

- `.claude/skills/dr-ask-the-right-question/` (question discipline),
- `.claude/skills/dr-drive-harness/` (driving manual + the "Calibration
  for less capable executors" block),
- `.claude/skills/README.md` (the workflow index),
- `docs/HANDOVER_2026-08-03.md` (the Sonnet-calibrated modularisation
  program, rungs 1–7).

An entry records an infrastructure claim that an executor session's RECORD
showed to be wrong, misleading, silent where it mattered — or
load-bearing-and-correct (a gate that fired as designed is evidence too,
and belongs here as much as a failure). Corrections to ordinary committed
documents stay in `docs/ERRATA.md`; defects in `src/` go to a
`deepreason-orchestrator` tranche, never here.

## Entry discipline (inherited from docs/ERRATA.md)

Append-only; never rewrite an entry — a correction to a correction is a
new entry. Evidence pointers only: every claim cites the executor
session's committed artifact (tranche ledger, commit hash, pasted output,
run root), never an impression of how the session "went". Entries are
written by whichever session holds the evidence: the executor session
itself (per the feed-instruction in `docs/HANDOVER_2026-08-03.md`) or the
monitoring session reviewing its record.

## Entries

**Awaiting first results.** No executor session has produced a committed
record yet (as of 2026-08-03, branch head at the delivery of the
modularisation handover). Per the operator's instruction, no judgment is
recorded before the record exists. The first entry will cite the first
executor tranche's artifacts.
